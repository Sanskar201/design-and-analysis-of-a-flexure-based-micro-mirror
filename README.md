This paper introduces a novel design and analysis
of a flexure-based micro-mirror capable of translating (piston
motion) up and down, enabling precise modulation of the phase
of light reflected from its surface. The proposed micro-mirror
design leverages the advantages of flexure mechanisms to achieve
high precision and reliability in phase modulation applications.
A comprehensive analysis of the mechanical performance of
the micro-mirror is presented, including theoretical validation
and finite element simulations. The results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed design in achieving accurate and
stable phase modulation over a wide range of operating conditions. 
Furthermore, potential high-impact applications of the
flexure-based micro-mirror in fields such as optical metrology,
adaptive optics, and telecommunications are discussed. Overall,
this research contributes to the advancement of micro-optical
systems by providing a robust solution for precise phase modulation, 
opening new avenues for innovative applications in various
domains requiring high-precision optical control
